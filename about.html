            <p>Sleep Token is a British rock band from London, formed in 2016. The group is an anonymous, masked collective led by a frontman using the moniker Vessel. They have been categorized under many different genres, including alternative metal, post-rock/metal, progressive metal, indie rock/pop, and djent. After self-releasing their debut extended play (EP) One in 2016, the band signed with Basick Records and issued a follow-up, Two, the next year. The group later signed with Spinefarm Records and released their debut full-length album Sundowning in 2019, which was followed in 2021 by This Place Will Become Your Tomb. A third album, Take Me Back to Eden, was released in May 2023.</p>
            <h3>Musical style</h3>
            <p>Since their formation, the members of Sleep Token have remained anonymous. Rich Hobson of Metal Hammer explains that the members, who all wear masks and cloaks, "obscure their faces, they don't talk onstage, and they have only ever done one interview", with that very publication.
            </p>
            <p>The lead singer and primary songwriter of the band is known by the moniker "Vessel". Vessel and II are the only members of the band who have been credited as performers on Sleep Token's studio albums. II is also the only member apart from Vessel who has been given songwriting credits.
            </p>
            <p>The group's focus on anonymity and visual style have been likened to similar practices employed by Ghost, Slipknot and Gwar. Slipknot's frontman Corey Taylor has praised the band's image and artistry, comparing their approach to the one Slipknot took in the band's early days.</p>
